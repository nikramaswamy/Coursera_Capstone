    "# Optimizing the Location of New Italian Restaurants in Toronto, CA\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Background Information and Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Several criteria are involved in the process of choosing a location to start a new restaurant. In major cities like Toronto, Canada, a restaurant owner has to be particularly aware of the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Their target demographic\n",
    "2. Whether or not their restaurant is likely to be frequented by the local population\n",
    "3. Effective marketing strategies to boost public awareness of their venue\n",
    "4. The existing competitors to the cuisine offered\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the relative difficulty of this task, the purpose of this study is to aid individuals who are planning to open a new Italian restaurant in Toronto choose the right location by both providing and analyzing data relating to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The per capita income of a given neighborhood\n",
    "2. The population of a given neighborhood \n",
    "2. The competitors already present within a given neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, the findings in this report will not only enable Italian restaurant owners to establish a restaurant in the right location, but it will also ensure the restaurant's profitability in the long term."

    "### II. Analytical Approach and Data Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make appropriate recommendations to restaurant owners about the ideal location to start a new Italian restaurant, data on the restaurant's competitors and target clientele will be needed. Of the factors relating to consumers, the biggest questions restaurant owners will need to answer are (1) whether or not the consumer is likely to eat at the restaurant based on their disposable income, and (2) whether there is a sufficiently large enough population in the neighborhood to attract a diverse customer base. The prediction is that the more wealthy a family is within a given neighborhood, the more likely they are to eat out at the restaurant. Moreover, it is expected that the more people there are in the neighborhood, the probability that the restaurant will attract more customers will be greater. \n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, looking at factors that do not pertain to consumers themselves, a restaurant owner will also have to consider the potential competitors to their business model based on whether there are similar restaurants offering the same cuisine as the new restaurant (in this case, Italian food). If there are, then it is expected that the restaurant will not be as profitable in the given location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate these hypotheses, data on per capita income for a given neighborhood as well as the population of each neighborhood will be needed; this will come from Canadian census data for the city of Toronto. Additionally, a list of Italian restaurants will be needed for each neighborhood to evaluate the threat competitors pose to the new restaurant's business model; this data will come from the Foursquare location database that is accessible online."

    "### IV. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the data tables and the maps generated in the section above indicated that there was a significant difference in the number of Italian restaurants located in Downtown Toronto compared to surrounding suburbian neighborhoods. After conducting an investigation to determine which of these neighborhoods would be the most profitable for a new restaurant owner to set up an Italian restaurant, it was found that the neeighborhood with the best balance of both a high average income and high population was the Annex. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Annex had an average income level of $112,766.00 and a population size of 30,526. This is beneficial for two reasons. First, the relatively high average income in the Annex neighborhood is more conducive to customers visiting a restaurant. This is because a family that has a higher disposable income is more capable and -- resultantly -- more likely to eat out at a new Italian restaurant. Second, the higher population of Annex means that there are more potential customers that the new restaurant can serve, making it an attractive location to build a strong customer base while increasing customer loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with regards to potential competitors, the green marker in the map above indicates that there are no other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. This is a significant advantage to a restaurant owner seeking to establish a new Italian restaurant in Toronto because it means that they will not have to compete with other restaurants and/or diners offering similar foods at lower prices. Therefore, it would be much easier to turn a profit."

    "These recommendations are relatively ironclad and definitely approximate the ideal neighborhood to build a restaurant in a manner that is both logical and conducive to turning a profit. However, to further concretize the findings of this report, it is important to consider other factors that could influence these findings. For example, it was assumed in the analytical approach section that a restaurant owner should look for a populated suburb to build their new Italian restaurant. Yet it is entirely possible that even though a community may have a higher population, it does not necessarily mean that its people prefer eating Italian food. For that reason, future studies should incorporate an analysis of consumer demand segmented by each of Toronto's neighborhoods to get a more accurate picture of what the new restaurant's profit margins can expeect to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, on the subject of profit margins, further analysis should be done to not just identify the ideal *location* of a new Italian restaurant, but also the restaurant's profit estimates. This would give a restaurant owner a much clearer picture of (1) where to locate their restaurant and (2) precisely how profitable that location would be for their business. "
